# Intel 8080 Emulator & Assembler - Version 2.1.0

A web-based Intel 8080 CPU emulator and assembler built with 100% pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. No frameworks, no dependencies. Designed for educational purposes and fully compatible with GitHub Pages.

## What's New in Version 2.1.0 (V2.1) 🚀

- **Stack View**: Interactive visual stack tracker panel displays the memory content around the Stack Pointer (`SP`), showing both 16-bit word values and high/low bytes.
- **Explanatory Flag Tooltips**: Hovering over the state flags (`S`, `Z`, `AC`, `P`, `CY`) displays detailed Spanish definitions describing why they change and how they are calculated.
- **Clear Code Button**: Added a new interactive "Clear Code" button next to "Assemble & Load" to easily clear the assembler code panel and status outputs.
- **Improved Reset Behavior**: Pressing the "Reset" button now completely resets everything—clearing CPU memory, resetting registers and status flags, halting active program intervals, clearing compiler messages, and resetting the memory view's starting pointer back to `0000H`.
- **Correct CPU Flag Management (V2)**:
  - **Auxiliary Carry (`AC`) flag** calculations are fully corrected for subtraction instructions (`SUB`, `SBB`, `CMP`) and decrements (`DCR`), matching the exact micro-operation behaviors of the physical Intel 8080 chip.
  - Added strict 8-bit masking (`& 0xFF`) on all rotates (`RLC`, `RAL`, etc.) to prevent accumulator overflow and ensure emulator stability.
- **Enhanced Assembler (V2)**:
  - Supports register pair aliases natively (`BC`, `DE`, `HL`, `SP`, `PSW`). For example, you can write `LXI BC, 1000H` and it compiles perfectly.
  - Strict assembler validations that reject illegal combinations such as `MOV M, M` or invalid registers (e.g. `MOV B, X`).
  - Strict validation of labels that prevents silent compilation failures when utilizing undefined labels.
  - Fully supports `RST` (Restart) instruction assembly.
- **Visual "Version 2.1" Badge**: Beautiful and stylized badge added to the header interface.
- **Unit and Regression Test Suite**: A comprehensive test suite in `test.js` to ensure the core CPU and Assembler stability.
- **Comprehensive Spanish Documentation (`INSTRUCTIONS.md`)**: A detailed manual detailing all commands, directives, registers, instruction sets, and a complete interactive **"Hello World"** template program!

## Features

- **8080 CPU Core**: Accurate emulation of the Intel 8080 instruction set.
  - Full support for Arithmetic, Logic, Data Transfer, Branching, and Stack instructions.
  - Implemented `DAA` (Decimal Adjust Accumulator).
  - Accurate Flag management (Sign, Zero, Auxiliary Carry, Parity, Carry).
- **Integrated Assembler**: Write and assemble 8080 mnemonics directly in the browser.
  - Supports labels and comments.
  - Supports `ORG` and `DB` directives.
  - Handles hex (e.g., `12H`, `0x12`) and decimal values.
- **CPU Dashboard**:
  - Real-time visualization of all registers (A, B, C, D, E, H, L, PC, SP).
  - Individual flag indicators with detailed interactive tooltips.
  - Interactive **Stack View** showing 16-bit word values and high/low bytes surrounding the Stack Pointer (`SP`).
  - Status display (Idle, Running, Halted).
- **8-bit Value Model**:
  - Main registers store one byte (`00H` to `FFH`).
  - Values can be interpreted as unsigned `0` to `255` or signed `-128` to `+127`.
  - See `INSTRUCTIONS.md` for notes about overflow/truncation, such as `MVI A, 2400` keeping only the low byte.
- **Interactive Memory Viewer**:
  - Live memory grid with search-by-address functionality.
  - Highlights the current instruction pointer (PC).
- **Execution Controls**:
  - **Assemble & Load**: Compiles your code and places it in memory.
  - **Run**: Executes the code at high speed.
  - **Stop**: Pauses execution.
  - **Step**: Executes one instruction at a time.
  - **Reset**: Clears registers and flags, resets PC to 0000H.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
2. Write your 8080 Assembly code in the "Assembler" text area.
3. Click **Assemble & Load**.
4. Use **Step** to debug or **Run** to execute the full program.
5. Watch the **Registers** and **Memory View** to see your code in action.

### Example Code (Hello World / Text Buffer Copy)
